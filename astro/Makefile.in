# ======================================================================
# This library is a suite of astronomical functions for calculating
# various items like when sun rise/set or moon rise/set will occur.
#
# These are useful for the weather station so that you know when to
# turn on or off sensors that are affected by day time, but it's also
# common for some stations to show this info, especially if you are
# astronomical based like myself
