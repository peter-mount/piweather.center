    <code>PIWeather.center</code> is a modular weather station which is designed to handle virtually
    any type of weather sensor.

    Although the project got its name from being run on a Raspberry PI,
    when I started to rewrite it from scratch I switched from the original C to GO which allows
    for simple cross compilation across many operating systems and architectures, so it's name
    now targeted at Raspberry PI class Single Board computers, or even a Docker container if you
    wanted.
