    The first weather station was based on <a href="https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pywws" target="_blank">pywws</a>
    as at the time I had a compatible weather station from Maplin.
    That ran from 2010 until March 2018 when a bird hit its sensor breaking it beyond repair.
</p>

<p>
    This project first started in April 2014 when I started to build a standalone weather station
    based around a Raspberry PI model A which is where the project got its name from.
</p>

<p>
    The original had a Wi-Fi adapter connected to it's sole USB port and a PI camera connected
    pointing upwards to take an all-sky view for timelapses and to calculate the amount of
    cloud cover.

    It also had a simple board connected to the GPIO pins which had some I2C sensors attached
    including a light meter and a UV sensor.
