<p>
    The <code>windchill</code> function calculates the windchill based on the temperature and wind speed.
    If the values passed are not of the correct type then this will return an error.
</p>
<p>
    This function is only valid for temperatures below 10&deg;C (50&deg;F) and for wind faster than 1.34m/s.
    As such the <a href="../feelslike/">feelslike</a> function may be more suitable as it's response will be
    dependent on the temperature and wind speed passed to it.

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>
    The Wind Chill Index used is that implemented by the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States in November 2001.
</p>
<p>
    It is determined by iterating a model of skin temperature under various wind speeds and temperatures using standard
    engineering correlations of wind speed and heat transfer rate.
    Heat transfer was calculated for a bare face in wind, facing the wind, while walking into it at 1.4 m/s (5.0 km/h; 3.1 mph).
    The model corrects the officially measured wind speed to the wind speed at face height, assuming the person is in an open field.
</p>
<p>
    The results of this model may be approximated, to within one degree, from the following equation:
</p>

<math class="math-block" display="block">
    <msub><mi>T</mi><mi>WC</mi></msub>
    <mo>=</mo> <mn>35.74</mn> <mo>+</mo> <mn>0.6215</mn><mi>T</mi>
    <mo>-</mo> <mn>35.75</mn> <msup><mi>v</mi><mn>0.16</mn></msup>
    <mo>+</mo> <mn>0.4275</mn> <mi>T</mi> <msup><mi>v</mi><mn>0.16</mn></msup>
</math>

<p>
    Where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>T</code> is the ambient dry bulb temperature (&deg;F)</li>
    <li><code>v</code> the wind speed in m/s.</li>
</ul>
