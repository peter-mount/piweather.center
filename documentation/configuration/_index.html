<p>
    The configuration of the weather station is held in the <code>etc</code> directory of the
    station's deployment.
</p>
<p>
    The directory contains all the required information the station needs to operate,
    from where each component is located,
    the sensors contained within the station,
    the destinations the station forwards data to external systems
    as well as the content of the dashboards displayed by the station.
