<p>
    The <code>amqp.yaml</code> file contains the definition of the amqp brokers to be used
    by the various components of the weather station.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
    The default configuration is enough to operate on a single node setup.
    Look at the clustering section for more information.
</div>
<p>
    The file contains named broker definitions which the various components can then
    use to gain access to RabbitMQ.
</p>
<p>
    The main one is <code>database</code> which is used by all the components to send data to
    <code>weatherdb</code>, however additional entries can be made as required
</p>

<h3 class="paragraph">Example</h3>
<pre># AMQP message broker definitions
# database is used by various components to send data to weatherdb.
# it is also used by weatherdb to receive that data
database:
  url: amqp://database:password@127.0.0.1
  exchange: weather

<p>
    Here's an example entry for <code>weatheringress</code> to receive data from RabbitMQ.
    In this instance we want to receive readings from other sources to calculate a new
    compound reading.
</p>
<p>
    For example, to calculate the Feels Like temperature
    requires Temperature, Humidity and Wind Speed.
    If those values are coming from different sources then we need a second entry:
