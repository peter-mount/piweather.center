<p>
    <code>geiger</code> is a standalone application which can connect a Geiger counter to the
    weather station.
</p>
<p>
    It's specifically written for the GQ GMS-320Plus Geiger counter, as that unit supports
    being connected to the system via USB, and it's protocol is well documented.
</p>
<p>
    It should be possible to add additional types of Geiger counter to this application in the future.
