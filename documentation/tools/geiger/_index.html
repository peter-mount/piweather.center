    <code>geiger</code> is a standalone application which can connect a Geiger counter to the
    weather station.
</p>
<div class="marginNote">
    Although this tool is specific to a single manufacturer as their protocol handles multiple models,
    it should be possible to add additional types of Geiger counter in the future.
</div>
<p>
    It's specifically written for the GQ GMC-320<em>Plus</em> Geiger counter, as that unit supports
    being connected to the system via USB, and it's protocol is well documented.

<h3 class="paragraph">Setup</h3>

<p>
    Setting up the Geiger counter is pretty simple.
    Just connect the Micro-USB cable to a USB port on the host as the unit presents a serial port.
</p>
<p>
    Next locate the port it's connected to, usually it's /dev/ttyUSB0 and use that for the
    <strong>-geiger-port</strong> parameter.
</p>

<p>
    The last part is to give the Geiger counter an ID within the station
    and optionally set <strong>-rootDir</strong> to point to your station's configuration directory.
</p>

<h3 class="paragraph">Syntax</h3>
<pre><strong>geiger</strong> -geiger-id <em>station.geiger</em> -geiger-port <em>/dev/ttyUSB0</em></pre>

<h4 class="paragraph">Options</h4>
<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th><th>Description</th><th>Required</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td>-geiger-id <em>id</em></td><td>Sets the unique id for this sensor</td><td>Required</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-geiger-port <em>device</em></td><td>Sets the serial port for this sensor</td><td>Required</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-rootDir <em>path</em></td><td>The location of configuration files</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>-geiger-baud <em>baudRate</em></td><td>The baud rate to use</td><td>Default: 115200</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3 class="paragraph">Example</h3>
<p>
    On my system, the counter appears as /dev/ttyUSB0 and gave it the id of <code>garden.geiger</code>.
    So to run the service:
</p>

<pre>/usr/local/piweather/bin/geiger -geiger-id garden.geiger -geiger-port /dev/ttyUSB0</pre>
