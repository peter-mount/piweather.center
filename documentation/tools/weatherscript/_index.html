    <code>weatherscript</code> is a standalone interpreter which, via a simple scripting language
    similar to C, provides the ability to run scripts against the recorded data.
</p>
<p>
    A primary use of this is in the generation of timelapse videos from a webcam where you can
    easily overlay data on each frame containing the weather information for that frame.

<p>
    You can also use it for generating reports from the recorded data.
