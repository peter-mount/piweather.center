# Example webserver configuration

[webserver]

# The port to listen on. If not defined this is 8080
#port    8080

# The context path, useful if serving from behind a proxy server.
#
# If this is defined this forms the start of the path within the server.
# So here, fenrir means that all url's served will start with /fenrir/.
#
# This also means that anyone trying to go to either / or /fenrir will be redirected
# to /fenrir/
#
#context fenrir

# By default we connect to IPv4 only unless one or both of the following
# are defined. In that case we connect to just the IP port's that are enabled
#ipv4   enabled
ipv6    enabled
