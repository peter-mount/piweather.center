# =============================================================
# Example Sensor configuration for the Pi Weather Board
# =============================================================
#
# The Pi Weather Board is an I2C based daughter board which
# contains several weather sensors and the ability to add
# two external one wire temperature sensors.
#
# This file contains the config required to add those sensors
# to the weather station.
#
# All you need to do is to enable these sensors by copying
# this file into your weatherstation's configuration directory.
# =============================================================

# On board temperature sensor, this has only a degree celsius
# resolution and as it's right next to the PI it's really the
# station enclosure temperature, hence we call it that
