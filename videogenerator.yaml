# Test videogenerator configuration
#
# In this instance we have a set of captured frames from which we generate
# a 4K MP4 video consisting of the raw and cloud cover images as well as
# a keogram of the visible sky.
#
# An example of the output with this specific configuration can be seen
# at https://area51.media/w/3t9ktgrsxnod8YEo1iX9WP
#
# The command line used to generate it was:
#
# videogenerator -v -c videogenerator.yaml -o /srv/ramdisk/test.mp4 -sf 24 -of 8
#
# where -sf means source frame rate of 24, -of means output frame rate of 8
# This slows it down so that 3.5 hours is reduced to 9 seconds.

# The video output size, 4K is recommended as it can then be scaled down easily
outputSize:
  # 4K resolution
  width: 3840
  height: 2160

# List of frame sources.
#
# For example, we have 2 here, one for the raw data and one for the calculated
# cloud cover
sources:
  - # Name of this section, currently unused
    name: "Raw sky"

      draw:

        y: 0
        # width & height of the image which will be scaled to fit.
        # if width but not height is set then the height is scaled accordingly.
        # if height but not width is set then the width is scaled accordingly.
        width: 1920
      # keogram of cloud cover, using horizontal mode here due to test data
      # being rotated 90 degrees
      keogram:
        # Y coordinate of horizontal line to sample. Normally x would be used.
        # X overrides Y but if neither is defined then x is set to the centre
        # of the image
        y: 1620
        # Height of the keogram in pixels in the rendered frame
        height: 400

        # to the sky and exclude the ground or buildings
